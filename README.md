Welcome to my React learning journey! 

Level - 1

Step 1: Introduction to React
· Understand the fundamental concepts of React.
· Learn about components, JSX, and props.

<-- Fundamentals -->

  React is a Javascript library created by Facebook to create user interface(UI). 
  React is used to make a single page application(SPA).
  React allows us to create reusable UI components.
  
  Components ->
  Each component is a part of the UI design which has its own logic and design as shown in the below image. So the component logic which is written in JavaScript makes it easy and run faster and can be reusable.
  Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.
  Components come in two types, Class components and Function components, in this tutorial we will concentrate on Function components.

  JSX ->
  JSX stands for JavaScript XML.
  JSX allows us to write HTML in React.
  JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.
  JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any createElement() and/or appendChild() methods.
  Rules of JSX -->
  · HTML code must wrap into one top level element.
  · Elements must be closed.
  · Attribute class = className
  · No if else condition inside jsx but ternary operator is okay.
  · JS expression in JSX must be wrapped in {}.

  Ternary Operator -->
  · The ternary operator is a simplified conditional operator like if / else.

     if (authenticated) {
     renderApp();
      } else {
      renderLogin();
     }

  Props ->
  · Props stand for properties.
  · Props are used to transfer data or information one components to another.
  · Props are read only.
  · Props are like function in JavaScript.
